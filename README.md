## Snake_Game
Implementation of popular arcade Snake game on FPGA using Verilog HDL
The objective of the game is simple yet addictive: control a growing snake as it moves around the screen, consuming food items to increase its length. The longer the snake becomes, the more challenging it becomes to avoid collision with the walls or its own body. With each bite, the snake grows, demanding more strategic maneuvering to avoid obstacles and reach higher scores.
